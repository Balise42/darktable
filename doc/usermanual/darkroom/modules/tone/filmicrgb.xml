                This module compresses the tonal range of an image by reproducing the tone and
                color response of classic film. Doing so, it will protect the colors and the
                contrast in mid-tones, recover the shadows, and compress bright highlights. It
                is very suitable in portrait photography, especially in back-lighting
                situations, but will need extra care when details need to be preserved in
                highlights (e.g. clouds).

                The module is derived from the same named module in Blender 3D modeller by T. J.
                Sobotka. While it is primarily intended to recover high-dynamic range from raw
                sensor data, it can be used with any image in replacement of the base curve
                module. A full tutorial with examples and comments on the results can be found

                Filmic rgb is the successor of the filmic module provided in Darkroom 2.6. While
                the underlying principles did not change much, users of the previous version
                should not expect a 1:1 translation of their workflow, and may find

    <title>Prerequisites</title>

<!-- IHU - my understanding is that the prerequisites don't change much, except for the 
      exposure settings - which I modified. Is that correct? -->

    <para>
      In order to get the best out of filmic, images need some preparation:
      <itemizedlist>

        <listitem><para>
          In-camera, expose the shot <quote>to the right</quote>. This implies under exposing
          the shot so that the highlights are at the right of the histogram, just on the verge
          of clipping, but not clipped. It does not matter if the picture preview is very dark
          on your camera screen: as long as highlights are unclipped, filmic should be able to
          recover details from the raw data. Beware that clipped data are not recoverable. Some
          cameras have a clipping alert preview to help you diagnose this, and some even have an
          highlight-priority exposure mode.
        </para></listitem>

        <listitem><para>
          In the <xref linkend="exposure">Exposure</xref> module, push the exposure until the
          midtones are clear enough. Do not worry about losing the highlights: they will be
          recovered as part of the filmic processing. However, it is important to avoid negative
          pixels in black areas: the computations done by filmic will result in unpredictable
          results in this case. For some cameras models (Canon, mainly), rawspeed, the raw
          decoding library of darktable, may set an exaggerated black level, resulting in
          crushed blacks and negative values. If so, brighten the blacks by setting a negative
          black level value in the exposure module.
        </para></listitem>

        <listitem><para>
          If you plan on using filmic's auto-tuners, use the white balance module first to
          correct any color casts and get neutral colors. In RGB color spaces, luminance and
          chrominance are linked, and filmic's luminance detection relies on accurate measures
          of both. If your picture is very noisy, add an initial step of denoising to help the
          black exposure readings, and use a high quality demosaicing.
        </para></listitem>

        <listitem><para>
          If you plan using filmic's chrominance preservation mode, avoid using any tone mapping
          module as well as the base curve module. These may produce unpredictable color shifts
          that would make the chrominance preservation useless. Neither of these modules is
          usually needed if you use filmic.

    <title>Usage</title>

    <para>
      The filmic rgb module aims at mapping the photographed scene dynamic range to the
      (smaller) image dynamic range, and finally to the (even smaller) screen dynamic range.
      This mapping is defined in three steps, each handled in a separate tab in the interface:
      <itemizedlist>

        <listitem><para>
          The
          <guilabel>scene</guilabel>
          tab contains the <quote>input</quote> settings of the scene: what constitutes middle
          grey, white and black in the photographed scene.
        </para></listitem>

        <listitem><para>
          The
          <guilabel>look</guilabel>
          tab contains the parameters of the mapping applied to the input parameters defined in
          the
          <guilabel>scene</guilabel>
          tab. Notably, this part of the module applies an S-shaped parametric curve to enhance
          the contrast and remap the grey value to the middle grey of the display. This is
          similar to what the base curve or tone curve modules do.
        </para></listitem>

        <listitem><para>
          The
          <guilabel>display</guilabel>
          tab defined the output settings to map the transformed image to the display. In
          typical use cases, this tab should only be used very rarely.
        </para></listitem>

      </itemizedlist>
    </para>

    <para>
      The sliders' ranges of filmic rgb are limited to usual and safe values, but values are
      allowed out of these ranges by clicking on the sliders with the right button and inputting
      values on the keyboard. Filmic has no neutral parameters resulting in a no-operation: as
      soon as the module is enabled, the image is always at least slightly affected.
    </para>

    <para>
      The curves at the top of the module are read-only and serve as a guide for the operations
      performed on the sliders. The bright curve is the tone mapping curve, where the abscissa
      represents the scene exposure, and the ordinate represents the display exposure. The dark
      curve is the desaturation curve, representing the percentage of saturation as function of
      the scene exposure.
    </para>

      <title>Middle-grey luminance (<guilabel>Scene</guilabel> tab)</title>
<!-- IHU - okay, I'm not clear on color spaces. My understanding is that filmic
        worked on XYZ and filmic rgb works on RGB - is that true? does that sentence make sense?
        :) -->
      <para>
        The middle-grey luminance is the luminance in RGB space of the scene referred 18% grey.
        Its color picker tool reads the average luminance over the drawn area. If you happen to
        have a grey card or a color chart (IT8 chart or colorchecker) shot in the scene lighting
        conditions, then the grey color picker tool can be used to quickly sample the luminance
        of the grey patch on the picture. In other situations, the color picker can be used to
        sample the average luminance of the subject.
      </para>
      <para>
        This setting has an effect on the picture that is analogous to a lightness correction.
        Values close to 100% do not compress the highlights but fail to recover shadows. Values
        close to 0% recover greatly the shadows but compress the highlights more harshly and
        result in local-contrast losses. The standard middle-grey value for linearly encoded
        camera RGB is 18%. Good values of grey are usually the average luminance of the whole
        picture or of the subject. In studio and indoors (low dynamic range scenes), proper grey
        values are found between 15-18%. In high dynamic range scenes (landscapes, back-lit
        portraits), proper grey values lie between 1.25 and 9%.
      </para>
      <para>
        When modifying the middle-grey luminance, the white and black exposures are
        automatically slided accordingly, to preserve the dynamic range from clipping and to
        help you set find the right parameter faster. If you are not happy with the auto
        adjustment performed by the grey slider, you can correct again the white and black
        exposure parameters afterwards.
      </para>
    </sect5>

    <sect5>
      <title>White relative exposure (<guilabel>Scene</guilabel> tab)</title>
      <para>
        The white relative exposure is the number of stops (EV) between pure white and the
        middle grey. It is the right bound of the dynamic range. It should be adjusted to avoid
        highlight clipping. The white exposure color picker tool reads the maximum luminance in
        RGB space over the drawn area, assumes it is pure white, and sets the white exposure
        parameter to remap the reading to 100% luminance.
      </para>
      <para>
        When the grey is set at 18%, the white exposure will always be around 2.45EV. When the
        grey is set at 100%, the white exposure should be set at 0EV.
      </para>
    </sect5>

    <sect5>
      <title>Black relative exposure (<guilabel>Scene</guilabel> tab)</title>
      <para>
        The black relative exposure is the number of stops (EV) between pure black and the
        middle grey. It is the left bound of the dynamic range. The black exposure color-picker
        tool reads the minimum luminance in RGB space over the drawn area, assumes it is pure
        black, and sets the black exposure parameter to remap the minimum reading to 0%
        luminance. The black color picker measurement is very sensitive to noise, and cannot
        identify if the minimum luminance is pure black (actual data) or just noise. It works
        better on low ISO pictures and with high quality demosaicing. When the color picker puts
        the black exposure at -16EV, it is a sign that the measure failed and you need to adjust
        it manually.
<!-- IHU is that still a thing? -->
      </para>
      <para>
        The black relative exposure allows you to choose how far you want to recover lowlights.
        Contrarily to the white exposure, it is not always possible to completely avoid clipping
        blacks. Every camera sensor has a maximum physical dynamic range for each ISO value (you
        can find them measured on
        <ulink url="https://www.dxomark.com/"
            ><emphasis>DXOmark</emphasis></ulink>
        or
        <ulink url="https://www.dpreview.com/"
            ><emphasis>DPreview</emphasis></ulink>),
        the software dynamic range in filmic (dynamic range = white exposure - black exposure)
        should generally not be greater than the physical dynamic range of the sensor (10-14EV
        in most cases). Note that the dynamic range of the scene can be lower than the camera's
        one, especially indoors.
      </para>
<!-- IHU my understanding is that the control of the S-curve is not an issue anymore
        because of the new spline - which allows more leeway there, and hence the caveats
        disappear. Correct? -->
    </sect5>

    <sect5>
      <title>Dynamic range scaling and auto-tune (<guilabel>Scene</guilabel> tab)</title>
      <para>
        The auto-tune color picker combines all three color pickers above, and allows to set the
        grey, white and black exposures all at once, using the average of the drawn region as
        the grey estimation, the maximum as the white, and the minimum as the black. This gives
        good results in landscape photography but usually fails for portraits and indoor scenes.
      </para>
      <para>
        When no true white and no true black are available on the scene, the maximum and minimum
        RGB values read on the image are not valid assumptions anymore, so the dynamic range
        scaling symmetrically shrinks or enlarges the detected dynamic range and the current
        parameters. This works with all color pickers, and adjusts the current values of white
        and black relative exposures.
      </para>
    </sect5>

    <sect5>
      <title>Contrast (<guilabel>Look</guilabel> tab)</title>
      <para>
        The filmic rgb S-curve is created from the user parameters, by computing the position of
        virtual nodes and interpolating them, similarly to the tone curve module (but here, the
        nodes cannot be moved manually). The filmic rgb S-curve is split into three parts: a
        middle linear part, and two extremities that move smoothly from the slope of the middle
        part to the ends of the exposure range.
      </para>
      <para>
        The
        <guilabel>contrast</guilabel>
        slider controls the slope of the middle part of the curve. While this allow a quicker
        curve parametrization, not all the combinations of parameter deliver good curves, and
        the graph display will give a diagnostic interface. Good curves are either graceful S
        with a linear central portion and curved extremities, or lines following the diagonal of
        the graph.
      </para>
      <para>
        The contrast parameter drives the slope of the central part of the curve. The larger the
        dynamic range is, the greater the contrast should be set, to avoid reversed branches
        that would invert the image contrast. Proper values of contrast lie between 1.4 (at 8EV
        dynamic range) and 1.7 (at 14EV dynamic range). This parameter will mostly affect
        mid-tones.
      </para>
    </sect5>

    <sect5>
      <title>Latitude</title>
      <para>
        The latitude is the range between the 2 nodes enclosing the central linear portion of
        the curve. The bigger the latitude is, the more linearly the luminance is affected,
        which is desirable to preserve the chrominance. The latitude defines the range of
        luminances that is not desaturated in the third step of filmic processing. This
        parameter will mostly affect extreme luminances. It is usually better to keep it as
        large as possible, and adjust the contrast to avoid clipping. Proper values lie between
        25% and 50% of the dynamic range, and should be increased by 1EV each time the grey
        value is divided by 2.
      </para>
    </sect5>

    <sect5>
      <title>Balance highlights/shadows</title>
      <para>
        By default, the latitude is distributed toward middle-grey accordingly to the dynamic
        range: when the dynamic range in centered in 0, it means the latitude is centered in
        50%. In real life situations, the dynamic range is often decentered, with a bigger part
        allowed to shadows, and so will be the latitude. However, this can produce clipping in
        blacks. The balance parameter allows to slide the latitude along the slope, toward the
        shadows or toward the highlights. This way, the contrast will be preserved in mid-tones,
        but more room will be allowed to one extremity of the dynamic range so clipping will be
        avoided. This should usually be used to center the latitude at 50%, on the graph
        display.
      </para>
    </sect5>

    <sect5>
      <title>Saturation</title>
      <para>
        The saturation parameter is a finetuning control that applies on top of the latitude
        parameter. By default, the picture is desaturated selectively in extreme luminances
        (near white and near black), and untouched in mid-tones. This is how film behaves and is
        also useful to avoid gamut clipping, because very bright and very saturated colours are
        usually out of the sRGB gamut.
      </para>
      <para>
        The desaturation mask is a gaussian window which standard deviation is latitude ×
        saturation, and which is centered on the latitude. As the latitude affects the luminance
        and the saturation, you should set it first, leaving the saturation at 100%. Once you
        are happy with the luminance mapping, you can then finetune the saturation parameter to
        adjust the desaturation.
      </para>
      <para>
        The saturation parameter sets at 100% means the desaturation window standard deviation
        is 100% of the latitude width. To desaturate more aggressively at extreme luminances,
        the saturation should be set lower than 100%. To almost disable the desaturation,
        saturation values can be set as high as 1000%, using right-click and inputting the
        values on the keyboard.
      </para>
    </sect5>

    <sect5>
      <title>Intent</title>
      <para>
        The intent parameter controls the interpolation algorithm used to derive the curve from
        the position of the nodes. It is similar to the tone curve module, but the options are
        translated into common language. <emphasis>Contrasted</emphasis> uses a cubic spline
        interpolation that produce a smooth round curve and pleasing contrast, however it can be
        sensible to nodes in close proximity and produce cusps and oscillations in this setup.
        <emphasis>Linear</emphasis> uses a monotonic Hermite interpolation that ensures the
        monotonicity of the curve, but produces a flatter contrast at the extremities.
        <emphasis>Faded</emphasis> uses a Catmul-Rom centripetal interpolation, designed to
        avoid cusps at all cost, but produces even flatter contrast at the extremities, which
        can be used creatively to emulate old faded photographs. <emphasis>Optimized</emphasis>
        is an average between the <emphasis>contrasted</emphasis> and
        <emphasis>linear</emphasis> modes, providing a fair trade-off at the expense of being
        heavier on the CPU.
      </para>
    </sect5>

    <sect5>
      <title>Preserve the chrominance</title>
      <para>
        The chrominance preservation mode is an advanced mode that cannot be used <quote>as
        is</quote> and needs extra-corrections. In regular mode, filmic applies its correction
        in ProPhotoRGB space, using the three RGB channels separately. This looks good most of
        the time, but can result in color hue shifts because no consistency between channels in
        ensured.
      </para>
      <para>
        When using the chrominance preservation mode, the RGB ratios are saved before any
        correction in filmic. Only the maximum of the three RGB channels is used in the
        tone-mapping, as an estimation of the luminance. At the end of the process, the RGB
        ratios are restored as before. This leads to marginally faster runtimes, and links the
        three RGB channels all along the process, to ensure the hue and the saturation are kept
        untouched, which is desirable when you performed precise color adjustments. However,
        this does not follow the eye response to luminance, so, keeping the saturation as is
        when pushing up the luminance will always look oversaturated. This is why, when using
        this mode, an extra desaturation should be performed, for example, using the output
        saturation in color balance module at 65 to 85%. In that case, color balance should be
        used to adjust the main saturation of the mid-tones, then an additional pass would fix
        the saturation of extreme luminances with the saturation parameter of filmic, set
        between 12 to 33%.
      </para>
      <para>
        It is advised to perform all filmic settings in the regular RGB mode (unlinked
        channels), then enable the chrominance preservation last, and then adjust the
        saturation.
      </para>
    </sect5>

    <sect5>
      <title>Black luminance</title>
      <para>
        The destination parameters set the target luminance values used to remap the tones
        through filmic. The default parameters will work 99% of the times, the remaining 1%
        being when you output in linear RGB space (REC709, REC2020) for media handling
        log-encoded data. These settings are then to be used with caution because darktable does
        not allow separate pipelines for display preview and for file output.
      </para>
      <para>
        The black luminance parameter allows to set the ground-level black of the target medium.
        Set it greater than 0% if you want raised, faded blacks to achieve a retro look.
      </para>
    </sect5>

    <sect5>
      <title>Middle-grey destination</title>
      <para>
        This is the middle-grey of the output medium, that is used as a target for the filmic S
        curve central node. On gamma corrected media, the actual grey is computed with the gamma
        correction (middle-grey^(1/gamma)), so a middle-grey parameter of 18% with a gamma of
        2.2 gives an actual middle-grey target of 45.87%.
      </para>
    </sect5>

    <sect5>
      <title>White luminance</title>
      <para>
        The white luminance parameter allows to set the ceiling level white of the target
        medium. Set it lower than 100% if you want dampened, muted whites to achieve a retro
        look.
      </para>
    </sect5>

    <sect5>
      <title>Destination power factor</title>
      <para>
        The power of the output transfer function, often improperly called the gamma (only
        screen have a gamma), is the parameter used to raise or compress the mid-tones to
        account for the display non-linearities or to avoid quantization artifacts when encoding
        in 8 bits file formats. This is a common operation when applying ICC color profiles
        (except for linear RGB spaces, like REC 709 or REC 2020, which have a linear
        <quote>gamma</quote> of 1.0). However, at the output of filmic, the signal is
        logarithmically encoded, which is not something ICC color profiles know to handle. As a
        consequence, if we let them apply a gamma 1/2.2 on top, it will result in a double up,
        and the middle-grey will be remapped to 76% instead of 45% as it should.
